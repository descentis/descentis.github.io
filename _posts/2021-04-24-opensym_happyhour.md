We organized an online event to popularize the OpenSym conference in Asia. [Gregorio Robles](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BhVjp-UAAAAJ&hl=en) served as the session chair of the event. We had two more commenters [Bj√∂rn Lundell](https://www.his.se/en/about-us/staff/bjorn.lundell/) and [Rishemjit Kaur](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GH809NUAAAAJ&hl=en). The idea of this event was to promote research in open collaboration domain as well as to promote the OpenSym conference.
